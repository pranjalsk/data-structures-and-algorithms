### Python Questions

#### Problem 1: Given an array having both positive and negative integers, implement functions to solve the maximum sub-array problem:
A. Using the brute-force method. 
B. Using the recursive method (you would need to implement a function to
solve the maximum crossing sub-array problem). 
C. Using the iterative method.

#### Problem 2: Given two square matrices A and B, implement functions to calculate the product AB:
A. Using matrix multiplication.
B. Using Strassen’s Algorithm.

#### Problem 1. Implement Singly Linked List
a) Your implementation should be able to add an element at the front of the linked list.
b) It should have the “remove” functionality as well as “contains” functionality.
c) You should also implement the repr function to display all the added elements in the linked
list.

#### Problem 2.Implement a Binary Search Tree Dictionary.
a) It should be able to insert, delete and retrieve items.
b) It should display all the keys using pre-order, in order post-order traversals.

#### Problem 3. Implement Chained Hash Table
a) Your implementation should be able to insert, retrieve and delete items in the hash table.
b) Your implementation should be tested for different bin counts and load factor.
c) You should test your implementation with the provided terrible_hash() to show ability for
collision resolution.

#### Problem 4. Implement Open Address Hash Table
a) Your implementation should be able to insert, retrieve and delete items in the hash table.
b) Your implementation should be tested for different bin counts and load factor.
c) You should test your implementation with the provided terrible_hash() to show ability
for collision resolution.
